# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction-using-ML-model
Focuses on credit card approval prediction using Random Forest and SVM models on the credit card approval dataset, achieving good accuracy.
Built a supervised machine learning solution to predict credit card approval outcomes using applicant data. Utilized Random Forest and SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithms to process and classify applications, achieving strong predictive accuracy. The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, highlighting the use of classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for model selection. Enables financial institutions to automate and optimize the credit card approval process, reducing manual review effort and supporting smarter decision-making.
